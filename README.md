# PRODIGY_DS_3
A repository filled with tasks I have completed as a Data Science Intern at Prodigy Infotech

My task involves constructing a model to determine which drug would be suitable for a future patient facing the same illness. The dataset comprises features such as Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol levels of the patients, with the target being the specific drug each patient positively responded to.

To achieve this, I developed a multiclass classifier using the training subset of the dataset. My approach involves building a decision tree, which will subsequently be employed to predict the appropriate drug class for an unknown patient. This model could prove invaluable in prescribing the most effective medication for new patients based on their individual characteristics.
